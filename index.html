            Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (1891–1956) popularly known as Babasaheb,
            was an Indian jurist, economist, politician and social reformer who
            inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement and campaigned against social
            discrimination against Untouchables (Dalits), while also supporting
            the rights of women and labour He was Independent India’s first law
            minister and the principal architect of the Constitution of India.

        <h2>Studies in the USA and the UK</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Maharaja of Baroda had a scheme to send a few outstanding scholars
          abroad for further studies. Of course, Bhimrao was selected – but he
          had to sign an agreement to serve Baroda state for ten years on
          finishing his studies.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="special">
          "For a successful revolution it is not enough that there is
          discontent. What is required is a profound and thorough conviction of
          the justice, necessity and importance of political and social rights."
        </div>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1913, he went to the USA where he studied at the world-famous
          Columbia University, New York. The freedom and equality he experienced
          in America made a very strong impression on Bhimrao. It was so
          refreshing for him to be able to live a normal life, free from the
          caste prejudice of India. He could do anything he pleased – but
          devoted his time to studying. He studied eighteen hours a day.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Visits to bookshops were his favourite entertainment!His main subjects
          were Economics and Sociology. In just two years he had been awarded an
          M.A. – the following year he completed his Ph.D. thesis. Then he left
          Columbia and went to England, where he joined the London School of
          Economics. However, he had to leave London before completing his
          course because the scholarship granted by the State of Baroda expired.
          Bhimrao had to wait three years before he could return to London to
          complete his studies.

        <h2>In the Prime of His Life</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Babasaheb had by this time collected a library of over 50,000 books,
          and had a house named Rajgriha built at Dadar in north Bombay to hold
          it. In 1935 his beloved wife Ramabai died. The same year he was made
          Principal of the Government Law College, Bombay.Also in 1935 a
          conference of Dalits was held at Yeola.
        </p>
        <p>
          Babasaheb told the conference: -We have not been able to secure the
          barest of human rights… I am born a Hindu. I couldn’t help it, but I
          solemnly assure you that I will not die a Hindu.” This was the first
          time that Babasaheb stressed the importance of conversion from
          Hinduism for his people – for they were only known as ‘untouchables’
          within the fold of Hinduism.During the Second World War, Babasaheb
          Ambedkar was appointed Labour Minister by the Viceroy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="special">
          "A people and their religion must be judged by social standards based
          on social ethics. No other standard would have any meaning if religion
          is held to be necessary good for the well-being of the people."
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Yet he never lost contact with his roots – he never became corrupt or
          crooked. He said that he had been born of the poor and had lived the
          life of the poor, he would remain absolutely unchanged in his
          attitudes to his friends and to the rest of the world.The All-India
          Scheduled Castes Federation was formed in 1942 to gather all
          ‘untouchables’ into a united political party.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />

        <h2>Leading Peaceful Agitation</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1927 Babasaheb Ambedkar presided over a conference at Mahad in
          Kolaba District. There he said: -It is time we rooted out of our minds
          the ideas of high and low. We can attain self-elevation only if we
          learn self-help and regain our self-respect.”Because of his experience
          of the humiliation and injustice of untouchability, he knew that
          justice would not be granted by others. Those who suffer injustice
          must secure justice for themselves.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Bombay Legislature had already passed a Bill allowing everyone to
          use public water tanks and wells. (We have seen how Bhim was denied
          water at school, in his office, and at other places. Public water
          facilities were always denied to ‘untouchables’ because of the
          superstitious fear of ‘pollution.’)Mahad Municipality had thrown open
          the local water tank four years earlier, but so far not one
          ‘untouchable’ had dared to drink or draw water from it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Babasaheb Ambedkar led a procession from the Conference on a peaceful
          demonstration to the Chowdar Tank. He knelt and drank water from it.
          After he set this example, thousands of others felt courageous enough
          to follow him. They drank water from the tank and made history. For
          many hundreds of years, ‘untouchables’ had been forbidden to drink
          public water.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          When some caste Hindus saw them drinking water, they believed the tank
          had been polluted and violently attacked the Conference, but Babasaheb
          Ambedkar insisted violence would not help – he had given his word that
          they would agitate peacefully.Babasaheb Ambedkar started a Marathi
          journal Bahishkrit Bharat (‘The Excluded of India’).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In it, he urged his people to hold asatyagraha (non-violent agitation)
          to secure the right of entry to the Kala Ram Temple at Nasik.
          ‘untouchables’ had always been forbidden to enter Hindu temples. The
          demonstration lasted for a month. Then they were told they would be
          able to take part in the annual temple festival. However, at the
          festival they had stones thrown at them – and were not allowed to take
          part. Courageously, they resumed their peaceful agitation. The temple
          had to remain closed for about a year, as they blocked its entrance.

          <h2>Architect of the Indian Constitution</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            After the war Babasaheb Ambedkar was elected to the Constituent
            Assembly to decide the way jthat India – a country of millions of
            people – should be ruled. How should elections take place? What are
            the rights of the people? How are laws to be made? Such important
            matters had to be decided and laws had to be made.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Constitution answers all such questions and lays down rules.When
            India became independent in August 1947, Babasaheb Ambedkar became
            First Law Minister of Independent India. The Constituent Assembly
            made him chairman of the committee appointed to draft the
            constitution for the world’s largest democracy.All his study of law,
            economics, and politics made him the best qualified person for this
            task.
          </p>
          <p>
            A study of the Constitutions of many countries, a deep knowledge of
            law, a knowledge of the history of India and of Indian Society – all
            these were essential. In fact, he carried the whole burden alone. He
            alone could complete this huge task.After completing the Draft
            Constitution, Babasaheb fell ill.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a nursing home in Bombay he met Dr. Sharda Kabir and married her
            in April 1948. On November 4, 1948 he presented the Draft
            Constitution to the Constituent Assembly, and on November 26, 1949
            it was adopted in the name of the people of India. On that date he
            said: -I appeal to all Indians to be a nation by discarding castes,
            which have brought separation in social life and created jealousy
            and hatred.”

          <h2>Convert Into Buddhism</h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            In 1950, he went to a Buddhist conference in Sri Lanka. On his
            return he spoke in Bombay at the Buddhist Temple. -In order to end
            their hardships, people should embrace Buddhism.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am going to devote the rest of my life to the revival and spread
            of Buddhism in India.”Babasaheb Ambedkar resigned from the
            Government in 1951. He felt that as an honest man he had no choice
            but to do so, because the reforms so badly needed had not been
            allowed to come into being.For the next five years Babasaheb carried
            on a relentless fight against social evils and superstitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            On October 14, 1956 at Nagpur he embraced Buddhism. He led a huge
            gathering in a ceremony converting over half a million people to
            Buddhism. Presently the place is known as “Deekshabhoomi”. He knew
            that Buddhism was a true part of Indian history and that to revive
            it was to continue India’s best tradition. ‘Untouchability’ is a
            product only of Hinduism.
